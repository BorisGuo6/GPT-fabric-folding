Let's start by finding the center of the cloth and its corners.

```python
# Find the center of the cloth
cloth_center = find_pixel_center_of_cloth(image_path, False)

# Find the corners of the cloth
cloth_corners = find_corners(image_path, False)
```

Next, we will define a function to identify the distance between each pair of corners and sort them in descending order of distance. This function takes the output of the find_corners function as its input and returns the corners that are farthest apart.

```python
import numpy as np

def find_farthest_corners(corners):
    # Calculate the distance between each pair of corners
    distances = []
    for i in range(len(corners)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(corners)):
            distance = np.sqrt((corners[i][0] - corners[j][0])**2 + (corners[i][1] - corners[j][1])**2)
            distances.append((distance, (corners[i], corners[j])))
    
    # Sort the distances in descending order
    distances.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Return the pair of corners that are farthest apart
    return distances[0][1]

farthest_corners = find_farthest_corners(cloth_corners)
```

Now, let's identify the pick and place points. According to the user command, we need to fold the cloth along its longer side. This means that one of the farthest corners will be the pick point and the other will be the place point.

```python
# Identify the pick and place points
pick_point = farthest_corners[0]
place_point = farthest_corners[1]

print("Cloth Center: ", cloth_center)
print("Cloth Corners: ", cloth_corners)
print("Pick Point: ", pick_point)
print("Place Point: ", place_point)
```

Next, we will append the chosen pick and place point to the test_pick_pixel and test_place_pixel list using the append_pixels_to_list() function.

```python
# Append the pick and place points to the respective lists
append_pixels_to_list(args.img_size, pick_point, place_point, test_pick_pixels, test_place_pixels)
```

Now, we will convert the 2-dimensional pick and place points into 3-dimensions using the get_world_coord_from_pixel function.

```python
# Convert the pick and place points to 3D
pick_point_3d = get_world_coord_from_pixel(pick_point, depth, camera_params)
place_point_3d = get_world_coord_from_pixel(place_point, depth, camera_params)
```

Finally, we will use the pick_and_place function to move the robot arm from the pick point to the place point.

```python
# Move the robot arm from the pick point to the place point
pick_and_place(pick_point_3d, place_point_3d)
```
