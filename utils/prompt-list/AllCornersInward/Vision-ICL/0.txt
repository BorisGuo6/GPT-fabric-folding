The placing point should be along the edge of the cloth, not at the center or a corner
Pick the cloth at the point indicated by the black dot at the corner of the cloth. Fold the cloth by bringing the picked point diagonally across to the opposite corner of the cloth, aligning it with the corner that is closest to the center of the background. Ensure the cloth lies flat after the fold
Pick the cloth at the point indicated by the black dot at the corner of the cloth. Fold the cloth by bringing the picked point diagonally across to the opposite edge, aligning it with the edge but not at a corner, effectively folding the cloth into a triangle that covers half of the cloth's area
Pick the cloth at the point indicated by the black dot at the corner of the cloth. Fold the cloth by bringing this point diagonally across to the opposite edge, aligning it with the edge while keeping the cloth flat on the surface
Pick the cloth at the point indicated by the black dot at the corner of the cloth. Fold the cloth diagonally across to the opposite edge, aligning the picking point with the edge that is parallel to the opposite side of the cloth, effectively folding the cloth into a triangle with the tip of the fold touching the middle of the opposite edge
Pick the cloth at the point indicated by the black dot at the corner of the cloth. Fold the cloth diagonally across to the opposite edge, aligning the picking point with the midpoint of the opposite edge, as indicated by the arrow's direction and length
Pick the cloth at the point marked by the black dot and fold it diagonally across to the opposite corner of the cloth, aligning the picked point with the diagonally opposite corner
Pick the cloth at the point marked by the black dot and fold it diagonally across to the opposite edge, aligning the picked point with the edge of the cloth directly across from it
Pick the cloth at the point marked by the black dot at the corner of the cloth. Fold the cloth by bringing this picking point diagonally across to the opposite edge of the cloth, aligning it with the edge such that the corner with the picking point now touches the midpoint of the opposite edge. This will create a diagonal fold across the cloth, resulting in a triangular shape with the pink side facing up on one half of the cloth
Pick the cloth at the point marked by the black dot at the corner of the cloth. Fold the cloth by bringing this point diagonally across to the opposite edge, aligning it with the edge but not at a corner or the center. The placing point should be along the edge, equidistant from the adjacent corners

Pick the point on the cloth indicated by the black dot at the base of the arrow. Fold the cloth by bringing this point diagonally across to the opposite edge of the cloth, aligning it with the edge so that the point you picked up touches the surface along the same edge from where you started. The fold should create a diagonal crease running from the picked point to the opposite corner of the cloth
Pick the point on the cloth indicated by the black dot at the base of the arrow. Fold the cloth by bringing this point diagonally across to the opposite edge of the cloth, aligning it with the edge such that the tip of the arrow now touches the edge, not the center or a corner. The cloth should now be folded into a triangle with the pink side partially visible
Pick the point on the cloth indicated by the black dot at the base of the arrow. Fold the cloth by bringing this point diagonally across to the opposite edge of the cloth, aligning it with the edge such that the tip of the arrow now touches the edge, not the center or a corner. The fold should create a new visible edge that runs from the center of one of the sides of the cloth to a corner, bisecting the cloth into two triangles, one orange and one pink
Pick the point on the cloth indicated by the black dot at the base of the arrow. Fold the cloth by bringing this point diagonally across to the opposite edge of the cloth, aligning it with the edge such that the tip of the arrow points towards the center of the edge. Ensure the cloth lays flat after the fold
Pick the point on the cloth indicated by the black dot at the base of the arrow. Fold the cloth by bringing this point diagonally across to the opposite edge of the cloth, aligning it with the edge such that the tip of the arrow points towards the center of the edge. The cloth should now be folded into a triangle with the pink side facing up along the fold
Pick up the cloth at the point indicated by the black dot at the corner of the cloth. Fold the cloth diagonally across to the opposite edge, aligning the picking point with the edge of the cloth that is parallel to the opposite edge from where you started. Ensure the cloth lays flat after the fold, with the pink side facing up along the folded section
Pick up the cloth at the point indicated by the black dot at the corner of the cloth. Fold the cloth diagonally across to the opposite edge, aligning the picking point with the edge such that the corner with the picking point now touches the midpoint of the opposite edge. This should create a fold that reveals the pink underside of the cloth along one half while the other half remains orange
