# Step 1: First Diagonal Fold

The first step is to fold the cloth along its diagonal. This means we need to bring one of the top corners to one of the bottom corners on the opposite side. 

Let's start by identifying the corners and the center of the cloth.

```python
# Identify the corners and center of the cloth
corners = find_corners(image_path, should_crop=True)
center = find_pixel_center_of_cloth(image_path, should_crop=True)
```

Now, let's identify the pick point and place point for the first fold. We will pick the top left corner and place it on the bottom right corner.

```python
# Identify the pick point and place point for the first fold
pick_point_1 = corners[0]  # Top left corner
place_point_1 = corners[3]  # Bottom right corner
```

Next, we need to convert these 2D points into 3D coordinates.

```python
# Convert the 2D points into 3D coordinates
pick_point_1_3D = get_world_coord_from_pixel(pick_point_1, depth, camera_params)
place_point_1_3D = get_world_coord_from_pixel(place_point_1, depth, camera_params)
```

Finally, we can perform the first fold.

```python
# Perform the first fold
pick_and_place(pick_point_1_3D, place_point_1_3D, lift_height)
```

# Step 2: Second Diagonal Fold

The second step is to fold the triangle along its longest side. This means we need to bring one of the top corners to the bottom corner on the opposite side. 

Again, let's start by identifying the corners and the center of the cloth.

```python
# Identify the corners and center of the cloth
corners = find_corners(image_path, should_crop=True)
center = find_pixel_center_of_cloth(image_path, should_crop=True)
```

Now, let's identify the pick point and place point for the second fold. We will pick the top left corner and place it on the bottom right corner.

```python
# Identify the pick point and place point for the second fold
pick_point_2 = corners[0]  # Top left corner
place_point_2 = corners[2]  # Bottom right corner
```

Next, we need to convert these 2D points into 3D coordinates.

```python
# Convert the 2D points into 3D coordinates
pick_point_2_3D = get_world_coord_from_pixel(pick_point_2, depth, camera_params)
place_point_2_3D = get_world_coord_from_pixel(place_point_2, depth, camera_params)
```

Finally, we can perform the second fold.

```python
# Perform the second fold
pick_and_place(pick_point_2_3D, place_point_2_3D, lift_height)
```

This completes the double triangle fold.
