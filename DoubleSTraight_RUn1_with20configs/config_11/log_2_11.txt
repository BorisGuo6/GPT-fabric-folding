Let's start by defining the function `identifyCornerRegions()` which will identify the regions of the corners of the cloth.

```python
import numpy as np

def identifyCornerRegions(corners):
    # Assuming corners is a numpy array with shape (4, 2) where each row is [x, y]
    top_corners = []
    bottom_corners = []
    left_corners = []
    right_corners = []
    
    # Find the median of the x and y coordinates to split the corners
    median_x = np.median(corners[:, 0])
    median_y = np.median(corners[:, 1])
    
    for corner in corners:
        if corner[0] <= median_x:
            left_corners.append(corner)
        else:
            right_corners.append(corner)
        
        if corner[1] <= median_y:
            top_corners.append(corner)
        else:
            bottom_corners.append(corner)
    
    # Return the corners categorized by region
    return [
        (top_corners, 'top'),
        (bottom_corners, 'bottom'),
        (left_corners, 'left'),
        (right_corners, 'right')
    ]
```

Next, we will define the function `identifyPickandPlace()` based on the user command.

```python
def identifyPickandPlace(corners):
    corner_regions = identifyCornerRegions(corners)
    bottom_right_corner = None
    top_left_corner = None
    
    # Find the bottom right and top left corners
    for region in corner_regions:
        if region[1] == 'bottom':
            bottom_right_corner = max(region[0], key=lambda x: x[0])  # Rightmost corner
        elif region[1] == 'top':
            top_left_corner = min(region[0], key=lambda x: x[0])  # Leftmost corner
    
    # Return the pick point and place point
    return bottom_right_corner, top_left_corner
```

Now, let's define the function `findDistanceAndDirection()` to calculate the distance and angle.

```python
def findDistanceAndDirection(pick_point, place_point):
    # Calculate the distance between the two points
    distance = np.linalg.norm(np.array(place_point) - np.array(pick_point))
    
    # Calculate the angle in radians
    delta_x = place_point[0] - pick_point[0]
    delta_y = place_point[1] - pick_point[1]
    angle = np.arctan2(delta_y, delta_x)
    
    return distance, angle
```

Next, we append the chosen pick and place points to the test_pick_pixels and test_place_pixels list.

```python
# Assuming pick_point and place_point have been identified
append_pixels_to_list(img_size, pick_point, place_point, test_pick_pixels, test_place_pixels)
```

Now, we convert the 2-dimensional pick and place points into 3-dimensions.

```python
pick_point_world = get_world_coord_from_pixel(np.array(pick_point), depth, camera_params)
place_point_world = get_world_coord_from_pixel(np.array(place_point), depth, camera_params)
```

Finally, we call the `pick_and_place` function with the 3D coordinates.

```python
pick_and_place(pick_point_world, place_point_world)
```

Now, let's execute each of these steps one by one. Please note that the actual execution of these steps would be done by the robot's control system, and the code provided here is a representation of the logic that would be implemented.
