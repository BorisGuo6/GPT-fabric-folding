Let's start by defining the function `identifyCornerRegions()` which will identify the corners of the cloth and categorize them based on their position.

```python
import numpy as np

def identifyCornerRegions(corners):
    # Assuming corners is a numpy array with shape (4, 2) where each row is [x, y]
    top_corners = []
    bottom_corners = []
    left_corners = []
    right_corners = []
    
    # Find the median y-coordinate to separate top and bottom
    median_y = np.median(corners[:, 1])
    # Find the median x-coordinate to separate left and right
    median_x = np.median(corners[:, 0])
    
    for corner in corners:
        if corner[1] < median_y:
            top_corners.append(corner)
        else:
            bottom_corners.append(corner)
        
        if corner[0] < median_x:
            left_corners.append(corner)
        else:
            right_corners.append(corner)
    
    # Return a list of tuples with corners and their respective regions
    return [
        (top_corners, 'top'),
        (bottom_corners, 'bottom'),
        (left_corners, 'left'),
        (right_corners, 'right')
    ]
```

Next, we'll define the function `identifyPickandPlace()` based on the user command.

```python
def identifyPickandPlace(corners, center):
    corner_regions = identifyCornerRegions(corners)
    pick_point = None
    
    # Find the top right corner
    for region in corner_regions:
        if region[1] == 'top':
            top_corners = region[0]
            pick_point = max(top_corners, key=lambda x: x[0])  # Rightmost point among the top corners
    
    place_point = center  # Center of the cloth
    return pick_point, place_point
```

Now, let's define the function `findDistanceAndDirection()` to calculate the distance and angle.

```python
def findDistanceAndDirection(pick_point, place_point):
    # Calculate the distance
    distance = np.linalg.norm(np.array(place_point) - np.array(pick_point))
    # Calculate the angle in radians
    angle = np.arctan2(place_point[1] - pick_point[1], place_point[0] - pick_point[0])
    return distance, angle
```

Next, we append the chosen pick and place points to the respective lists.

```python
# Assuming pick_point and place_point have been identified
append_pixels_to_list(img_size, pick_point, place_point, test_pick_pixels, test_place_pixels)
```

Now, we convert the 2D pick and place points into 3D coordinates.

```python
# Convert pick point
pick_pos_3d = get_world_coord_from_pixel(np.array(pick_point), depth, camera_params)
# Convert place point
place_pos_3d = get_world_coord_from_pixel(np.array(place_point), depth, camera_params)
```

Finally, we call the `pick_and_place()` function with the 3D coordinates.

```python
pick_and_place(pick_pos_3d, place_pos_3d)
```

Now, let's execute each of these steps one by one. Please note that the actual execution of these steps would be done by the robot's control system, and the code provided here is a representation of the logic that would be implemented.
