Let's start by defining the function `identifyCornerRegions()` as per step 1:

```python
import numpy as np

def identifyCornerRegions(corners):
    # Assuming corners is a numpy array with shape (4, 2) where each row is a corner [x, y]
    top_corners = []
    bottom_corners = []
    left_corners = []
    right_corners = []
    
    # Find the median y-coordinate to separate top and bottom
    median_y = np.median(corners[:, 1])
    # Find the median x-coordinate to separate left and right
    median_x = np.median(corners[:, 0])
    
    for corner in corners:
        if corner[1] < median_y:
            top_corners.append(corner)
        else:
            bottom_corners.append(corner)
        
        if corner[0] < median_x:
            left_corners.append(corner)
        else:
            right_corners.append(corner)
    
    # Return the corners categorized by region
    return [
        (top_corners, 'top'),
        (bottom_corners, 'bottom'),
        (left_corners, 'left'),
        (right_corners, 'right')
    ]
```

Next, we'll define the function `identifyPickandPlace()` as per step 2:

```python
def identifyPickandPlace(corners, center):
    regions = identifyCornerRegions(corners)
    bottom_right_corner = None
    for region_corners, region in regions:
        if region == 'bottom':
            # Assuming the rightmost corner in the bottom region is the bottom right corner
            bottom_right_corner = max(region_corners, key=lambda c: c[0])
    
    if bottom_right_corner is None:
        raise ValueError("Bottom right corner not found")
    
    # The pick point is the bottom right corner and the place point is the center
    pick_point = bottom_right_corner
    place_point = center
    
    return pick_point, place_point
```

Now, let's define the function `findDistanceAndDirection()` as per step 3:

```python
def findDistanceAndDirection(pick_point, place_point):
    # Calculate the distance between the two points
    distance = np.linalg.norm(place_point - pick_point)
    # Calculate the angle in radians
    angle = np.arctan2(place_point[1] - pick_point[1], place_point[0] - pick_point[0])
    return distance, angle
```

Next, we'll append the chosen pick and place point to the test_pick_pixel and test_place_pixel list using the `append_pixels_to_list()` function as per step 4:

```python
# Assuming pick_point and place_point have been identified using identifyPickandPlace()
append_pixels_to_list(img_size, list(pick_point), list(place_point), test_pick_pixels, test_place_pixels)
```

Now, we'll convert the 2-dimensional pick and place points into 3-dimensions using the `get_world_coord_from_pixel` function as per step 5:

```python
pick_point_3d = get_world_coord_from_pixel(np.array(pick_point), depth, camera_params)
place_point_3d = get_world_coord_from_pixel(np.array(place_point), depth, camera_params)
```

Finally, we'll call the `pick_and_place` function with the 3D coordinates as per step 6:

```python
pick_and_place(pick_point_3d, place_point_3d)
```

Now, let's execute each of these steps one by one. Please note that the actual execution of these steps would be done by the robot's control system, and the code provided here is a representation of the logic that would be implemented.
