Let's start by defining the function `identifyCornerRegions()` which will identify the corners of the cloth and categorize them based on their position.

```python
import numpy as np

def identifyCornerRegions(corners: np.ndarray) -> list:
    # Assuming corners are provided in the format [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], [x4, y4]]
    # where (x1, y1) is the top-left corner and so on in a clockwise direction.
    
    # Sort corners by y-coordinate to separate top and bottom
    sorted_by_y = corners[np.argsort(corners[:, 1])]
    top_corners = sorted_by_y[:2]
    bottom_corners = sorted_by_y[2:]
    
    # Sort top and bottom corners by x-coordinate to separate left and right
    top_left = top_corners[np.argmin(top_corners[:, 0])]
    top_right = top_corners[np.argmax(top_corners[:, 0])]
    bottom_left = bottom_corners[np.argmin(bottom_corners[:, 0])]
    bottom_right = bottom_corners[np.argmax(bottom_corners[:, 0])]
    
    # Return a list of tuples with corner coordinates and their region
    return [
        (top_left, 'top left'),
        (top_right, 'top right'),
        (bottom_left, 'bottom left'),
        (bottom_right, 'bottom right')
    ]
```

Next, we'll define the function `identifyPickandPlace()` based on the user command.

```python
def identifyPickandPlace(corners_info: list) -> tuple:
    # Find the top right and bottom right corners from the corners_info
    top_right_corner = None
    bottom_right_corner = None
    for corner, region in corners_info:
        if region == 'top right':
            top_right_corner = corner
        elif region == 'bottom right':
            bottom_right_corner = corner
    
    # The pick point is the top right corner
    pick_point = top_right_corner
    
    # The place point is along the edge of the bottom right quadrant
    # Assuming this means halfway down the right edge of the cloth
    place_point_x = bottom_right_corner[0]
    place_point_y = (bottom_right_corner[1] + top_right_corner[1]) / 2
    place_point = np.array([place_point_x, place_point_y])
    
    return pick_point, place_point
```

Now, let's define the function `findDistanceAndDirection()` to calculate the distance and angle.

```python
def findDistanceAndDirection(pick_point: np.ndarray, place_point: np.ndarray) -> tuple:
    # Calculate the distance between the pick and place points
    distance = np.linalg.norm(place_point - pick_point)
    
    # Calculate the angle in radians between the two points
    delta_x = place_point[0] - pick_point[0]
    delta_y = place_point[1] - pick_point[1]
    angle = np.arctan2(delta_y, delta_x)
    
    return distance, angle
```

Next, we append the chosen pick and place points to the respective lists.

```python
# Assuming img_size, test_pick_pixels, and test_place_pixels are defined globally
append_pixels_to_list(img_size, list(pick_point), list(place_point), test_pick_pixels, test_place_pixels)
```

Now, we convert the 2D pick and place points into 3D coordinates.

```python
# Assuming depth and camera_params are defined globally
pick_point_3d = get_world_coord_from_pixel(pick_point, depth, camera_params)
place_point_3d = get_world_coord_from_pixel(place_point, depth, camera_params)
``
