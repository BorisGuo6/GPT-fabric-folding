Let's start by defining the function `identifyCornerRegions()` which will identify the corners of the cloth and categorize them based on their position.

```python
import numpy as np

def identifyCornerRegions(corners):
    # Assuming corners is a numpy array with shape (4, 2) where each row is [x, y]
    top_corners = []
    bottom_corners = []
    left_corners = []
    right_corners = []
    
    # Find the median of the x and y coordinates to split the corners
    median_x = np.median(corners[:, 0])
    median_y = np.median(corners[:, 1])
    
    for corner in corners:
        if corner[0] <= median_x:
            left_corners.append(corner)
        else:
            right_corners.append(corner)
        
        if corner[1] <= median_y:
            top_corners.append(corner)
        else:
            bottom_corners.append(corner)
    
    # Return a list of tuples with corners and their respective regions
    return [
        (top_corners, 'top'),
        (bottom_corners, 'bottom'),
        (left_corners, 'left'),
        (right_corners, 'right')
    ]
```

Next, we will define the function `identifyPickandPlace()` based on the user command.

```python
def identifyPickandPlace(corners):
    corner_regions = identifyCornerRegions(corners)
    bottom_right_corner = None
    top_right_quadrant_edge = None
    
    # Find the bottom right corner
    for corner, region in corner_regions:
        if 'bottom' in region and 'right' in region:
            bottom_right_corner = corner[0]  # Assuming the first one is the bottom right
    
    # Calculate the edge of the top right quadrant
    # Assuming the top right quadrant edge is at the median y-coordinate and the maximum x-coordinate
    median_y = np.median(corners[:, 1])
    max_x = np.max(corners[:, 0])
    top_right_quadrant_edge = np.array([max_x, median_y])
    
    return bottom_right_corner, top_right_quadrant_edge
```

Now, let's define the function `findDistanceAndDirection()` to calculate the distance and angle.

```python
def findDistanceAndDirection(pick_point, place_point):
    # Calculate the distance between the two points
    distance = np.linalg.norm(place_point - pick_point)
    
    # Calculate the angle in radians between the two points
    delta_x = place_point[0] - pick_point[0]
    delta_y = place_point[1] - pick_point[1]
    angle = np.arctan2(delta_y, delta_x)
    
    return distance, angle
```

Next, we append the chosen pick and place points to the test_pick_pixels and test_place_pixels list.

```python
# Assuming pick_point and place_point are already defined
append_pixels_to_list(img_size, pick_point.tolist(), place_point.tolist(), test_pick_pixels, test_place_pixels)
```

Now, we convert the 2-dimensional pick and place points into 3-dimensions.

```python
# Assuming pick_point and place_point are already defined
pick_point_3d = get_world_coord_from_pixel(pick_point, depth, camera_params)
place_point_3d = get_world_coord_from_pixel(place_point, depth, camera_params)
```

Finally, we call the `pick_and_place` function with the 3D coordinates.

```python
pick_and_place(pick_point_3d, place_point_3d)
```

Now, let's execute each of these steps one by one. Please note that the actual execution of these steps would be done by the robot's control system
