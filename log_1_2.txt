Printing for config 2 step 1
I apologize for the confusion. The error is due to the fact that the cloth_corners array is expected to have 4 corners, but it seems to have less. Let's modify the code to handle this situation.

```python
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Define the function identifyCornerRegions()
def identifyCornerRegions(corners):
    # corners is a numpy array of shape (4,2)
    # Each row represents a corner of the cloth
    # Each row is of the form [x-coordinate, y-coordinate]
    
    # Find the center of the cloth
    center = np.mean(corners, axis=0)
    
    # Initialize lists to store the corners
    top_corners = []
    bottom_corners = []
    left_corners = []
    right_corners = []
    
    # Iterate over the corners
    for i in range(corners.shape[0]):
        # If the y-coordinate of the corner is less than the y-coordinate of the center, it is a top corner
        if corners[i,1] < center[1]:
            top_corners.append(tuple(corners[i]))
        # If the y-coordinate of the corner is greater than the y-coordinate of the center, it is a bottom corner
        else:
            bottom_corners.append(tuple(corners[i]))
        
        # If the x-coordinate of the corner is less than the x-coordinate of the center, it is a left corner
        if corners[i,0] < center[0]:
            left_corners.append(tuple(corners[i]))
        # If the x-coordinate of the corner is greater than the x-coordinate of the center, it is a right corner
        else:
            right_corners.append(tuple(corners[i]))
    
    # Return the corners and their regions
    return top_corners, bottom_corners, left_corners, right_corners
```

```python
# Step 2: Define the function identifyPickandPlace()
def identifyPickandPlace(top_corners, bottom_corners):
    # The pick points are the top corners
    pick_pos_1 = top_corners[0]
    pick_pos_2 = top_corners[1] if len(top_corners) > 1 else top_corners[0]
    
    # The place points are the bottom corners
    place_pos_1 = bottom_corners[0]
    place_pos_2 = bottom_corners[1] if len(bottom_corners) > 1 else bottom_corners[0]
    
    return pick_pos_1, pick_pos_2, place_pos_1, place_pos_2
```

```python
# Step 3: Call the above function
top_corners, bottom_corners, left_corners, right_corners = identifyCornerRegions(cloth_corners)
pick_pos_1, pick_pos_2, place_pos_1, place_pos_2 = identifyPickandPlace(top_corners, bottom_corners)
```

```python
# Step 4: Print the values
print("Pick Position 1: ", pick_pos_1)
print("Pick Position 2: ", pick_pos_2)
print("Place Position 1: ", place_pos_1)
print("Place Position 2: ", place_pos_2)
```

```python
# Step 5: Define the function findDistanceAndDirection()
def findDistanceAndDirection(pick_pos, place_pos):
    # Calculate the distance between the pick point and the place point
    distance = np.sqrt((pick_pos[0] - place_pos[0])**2 + (pick_pos[1] - place_pos[1])**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the pick point and the place point
    angle = np.arctan2(place_pos[1] - pick_pos[1], place_pos[0] - pick_pos[0])
